When we try to share data objects among different applications created by different develop language and depends on different environment.
Use Protocol Buffer

Protocol Buffer VS other ways.
1. Java native way to serialize object. ==> Can only be deserialized in Java.
2. Ad-hoc way such as using ';' or ',' as splitter to make 'XXX,YYY,ZZZ' ==> Not intuitive for developers.
3. Convert to XML file or DB ==> Performance penalty. Since XML parsing need load whole file into memory.
